class LightScheduler:
    """
    A Singleton class that manages light scheduling using machine learning.

    This class uses LightGBM to learn patterns from historical activity data
    and generate optimal lighting schedules. It implements the Singleton
    to ensure only one instance manages the scheduling system.

    Attributes:
        model (lightgbm.Booster): Trained LightGBM model
        interval_minutes (int): Time interval for schedule segments
            (default: 10)
        min_confidence (float): Minimum prediction confidence threshold 
            (default: 0.6)
        schedule_cache (dict): Cache for current day's schedule
        db (DatabaseConnection): Database connection instance
        model_params (dict): LightGBM model parameters
