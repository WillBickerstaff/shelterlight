# Shelter Light Control System - Setup & Configuration

## ‚ú® USB Configuration Behaviour

When a USB device is inserted and mounted at `media_mount_point`, the following will occur:

1. **Configuration Validity Check:**
   - If a `config.ini` is found on the USB device, it will be validated.

2. **Backup Existing Config & Logs:**
   - **All configuration and log files, including rotated logs, will be backed up to the USB device regardless of whether the USB contains a valid `config.ini`.**

3. **Apply New Configuration (if valid):**
   - If the USB `config.ini` is valid, it will be copied to the system.

4. **Restart (if valid):**
   - If a valid configuration is applied, the main loop will restart to load the new configuration.

If the `config.ini` on the USB is **invalid or missing**, the system will still back up existing configuration and logs, but continue using the current configuration.

**For a detailed description of backup operation, configuration options and behaviour, see [config.readme.md](./config.readme.md).**

## üìÇ Python Environment Setup

This system is written in **Python 3.13.2** and is intended to run on Raspberry Pi Zero (or similar).

### üî• Required Python Libraries

The following Python packages are required:

- `RPi.GPIO` ‚Äî Raspberry Pi GPIO control
- `pyserial` ‚Äî Serial communication for GPS module
- `lightgbm` ‚Äî Machine learning for schedule prediction
- `psycopg2` ‚Äî PostgreSQL database driver
- `pandas` ‚Äî Data manipulation
- `numpy` ‚Äî Numerical operations

A complete list is provided in `req_modules.txt`:

```
RPi.GPIO
pyserial
lightgbm
psycopg2
pandas
numpy
```

---

### ‚úÖ Installation

To avoid affecting your system Python environment, it is recommended to install dependencies in a **virtual environment**.

#### 1. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r req_modules.txt
```

---

## üöÄ Running as a Systemd Service

This system is configured to run automatically at boot using **systemd**.

### üóÇÔ∏è Service File

Create a new systemd service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shelterlight.service
```

Paste the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shelter Light Controller
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pi/shelterlight/venv/bin/python /home/pi/shelterlight/shelterlight.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/shelterlight
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
User=pi
Group=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Enable & Start the Service

Run the following commands to enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable shelterlight.service
sudo systemctl start shelterlight.service
sudo systemctl status shelterlight.service
```

---

### üîÑ Auto-Restart Behaviour

The service is configured with:

```ini
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
```

This means the service will automatically restart **5 seconds** after any unexpected failure.

---

### üìÑ Logs

To view runtime logs:

```bash
journalctl -u shelterlight.service -f
```

---

### ‚õîÔ∏è Stopping & Disabling

```bash
sudo systemctl stop shelterlight.service
sudo systemctl disable shelterlight.service
```

---

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- The service requires access to GPIO and USB devices.
- Make sure all hardware components are connected before starting the service.
- If using **System Time Sync from GPS**, ensure appropriate `sudoers` permissions.

---

## üïí System Time Synchronisation

The system uses the GPS module as the authoritative time source. After a successful fix, the system clock is updated to GPS-provided **UTC time**.

### ‚ú® How it works

After a valid fix, the system executes:

```bash
sudo /bin/date -s <utc_time>
```

This will synchronise the Raspberry Pi system time to UTC.

### üîí Permissions & Security

Setting system time requires **sudo** privileges.

1. **Create a sudoers rule:**
    ```bash
    sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shelterlight
    ```
    Add:
    ```
    pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/date
    ```

2. **Disable NTP (Optional)**
    ```bash
    sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
    ```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Why this is necessary

The Raspberry Pi Zero does not have a battery-backed RTC. This system operates offline and uses GPS as the only reliable time source.

---

## üìÑ Log File Management

### üåÄ Log Rotation

To prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space, it is recommended to configure **logrotate** for the shelter light log files.

This will ensure that old logs are compressed and automatically removed after a defined retention period.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Example

Create a logrotate configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/shelterlight
```

Example content:

```bash
/home/pi/shelterlight/shelterlight.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    delaycompress
    copytruncate
}
```

**Explanation:**

| Option         | Description                                                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `daily`      | Rotate the log file daily.                                     |
| `rotate 7`  | Keep the last 7 rotated log files.                             |
| `compress`  | Compress old log files to save space.                          |
| `missingok` | Do not raise an error if the log file is missing.              |
| `notifempty`| Do not rotate if the log file is empty.                        |
| `delaycompress` | Compress the previous log file, not the current one.           |
| `copytruncate`| Truncate the original log file after creating a copy.         |

---

### üöÄ Apply Logrotate Immediately (Optional)

You can manually force logrotate to test your configuration:

```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/shelterlight
```

---

### üîÑ Automatic Execution

By default, logrotate runs daily via **cron** on Raspberry Pi OS.
No additional action is required after creating the config file.

---

### üíæ USB Backup of Rotated Logs

When a USB device is inserted, **all log files, including rotated and compressed logs**, will be backed up to the USB drive.
This includes:

- `shelterlight.log`
- `shelterlight.log.1`
- `shelterlight.log.2.gz`
- etc.

The backup files will be renamed to include an ISO-formatted timestamp:

```
/media/usb/smartlight/logs/shelterlight.log_backup_2025-03-31T14:23:07
/media/usb/smartlight/logs/shelterlight.log.1_backup_2025-03-31T14:23:07
/media/usb/smartlight/logs/shelterlight.log.2.gz_backup_2025-03-31T14:23:07
```

The backup operation happens **once per USB insertion event.**
If the USB is removed and re-inserted, a fresh backup will be created.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Overview

The system uses an `.ini` configuration file (`config.ini`) to control behaviour, GPIO pin assignments, database connection, location fallback, GPS settings, and more. Default values are embedded in the system and automatically used if options are missing.

Full configuration documentation is provided in [config.readme.md](./config.readme.md).
